### Where to pick up work

	4. Click on the issue and ***assign*** it to yourself 
	5. Move the card to the **In Progress** column.

2. After selecting your work, it is time to code and merge it to the **[dev]** branch. To do this, follow the Git Workflow instructions
	1. Create a new git branch from **[dev]**
	2. Name that branch **{name}/{description}**. For example, if Albert is updating the README.md doc. He will create a branch named **albert/update-readme**
	3. Finish coding and push your branch up to GitHub (aka origin)
	4. Get your code peer reviewed. Navigate to [pull requests](https://github.com/muhammadkeyton/Todo-App/pulls), and click on **New Pull Requests**
	5. Select your branch and create the pull request
